Header files:
Use 
"ifndef _FILE_NAME_. _FILE_NAME_ is just the file name in all caps and the . is replaced with _.
For example, take Cars.h, it would be 
#ifndef CARS_H 
#define CARS_H
{body}
#endif

Procedural programming: creating functions that perform operations on data.
OOP: creating objects that contain both functions and data.

Class syntax:

	public:
		int myNum
		string myString
};
myNum, myString are attributes. "public" is an access specifier. It signifies that the following methods and attributes 
are publicly accessible 

Workflow to execute cpp code in linux: 
g++ {filename.cpp} -o {executable file} - this compiles the file and sets the output as the exec file. No .exe needed.
./{executable file} - this executes the code and sends the output to the terminal.
Note that if a file is updated, you need to save the file and recompile it using g++ for the changes to take place.
